# Spec Quality Checklist: Web Service Based GUI

**Purpose**: Validate spec completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios defined
- [x] Edge cases identified
- [x] Scope boundaries clear
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in success criteria

- Success criteria updated to be technology-agnostic while remaining measurable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
