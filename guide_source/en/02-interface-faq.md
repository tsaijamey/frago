# Interface FAQ

## Q: What's the difference between Console and Tasks? Which should I use?

**A**: Console is a dedicated environment for Recipe development, while Tasks is for deterministic task execution. Both auto-approve all operations.

| Feature | Console | Tasks |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Develop and test Recipes | Execute deterministic tasks |
| **Session Display** | Current development session | All task list |
| **Use Cases** | Explore webpages, debug Recipes, quick experiments | Run existing Recipes, execute standardized tasks |

**Usage Recommendations**:

- **Use Console for development**: When you want AI to explore how to complete a task (e.g., "help me figure out how to extract data from this webpage")
- **Use Tasks for execution**: When you want to run an existing Recipe or execute tasks that don't need mid-course adjustments

**Important Note**:
⚠️ Console auto-executes all operations (file modifications, command execution, etc.). Be careful when using it on sensitive projects. For full manual control, use `claude -p "your task"` from the command line.

## Q: What does Recipe mean?

**A**: A Recipe is a standardized automation task defined by frago, including complete task descriptions, parameter definitions, and execution logic. Think of it as a "saved cooking recipe."

**Why is it called Recipe?**

Just like cooking recipes:
- 📝 **Has clear steps**: Recipe defines the specific workflow to complete a task
- 🔧 **Can adjust parameters**: Like adjusting salt in cooking, Recipes can take different URLs, keywords, etc.
- ♻️ **Can be reused**: Create once, use anytime with the same method

**Recipe Types**:

1. **Atomic Recipe**
   - Solves a single problem
   - Example: `screenshot_tab` - Screenshot current webpage
   - Characteristics: Simple, composable

2. **Workflow Recipe**
   - Chains multiple steps
   - Example: Scrape webpage → Extract data → Save to file
   - Characteristics: Complex, highly automated

**Where to find Recipes?**

- **Local Recipes**: Your local recipes (including ones you created and installed from community)
- **Community Recipes**: Official frago and community-contributed recipe library

**How to use a Recipe?**

1. Go to Recipes page
2. Find the Recipe you need
3. Click "Run" button
4. Fill in required parameters (if any)
5. Execute and view results

**Example**:
```
Recipe: web_extract_to_json
Parameters:
  - url: https://example.com/products
  - selectors: {"title": "h1", "price": ".price"}
  - output_file: products.json

After execution, it will automatically visit the webpage, extract data, and save as JSON
```

## Q: What is Workspace for?

**A**: Workspace is frago's project file browser, used to view and manage all files in Run projects (code, logs, screenshots, etc.).

**Why do we need Workspace?**

When you execute tasks with frago, it creates a "Run project" to store all related files:
- 📁 Generated code files
- 📸 Webpage screenshots
- 📝 Execution logs
- 💾 Downloaded data

Workspace lets you browse these files directly in the Web UI without opening a file manager.

**Directory Structure**:

```
~/.frago/projects/
└── run-20260117-143022/          # Run project directory
    ├── recipes/                   # Files generated by Recipe execution
    │   ├── screenshot.png
    │   └── data.json
    ├── workspace/                 # Workspace files
    │   └── script.py
    └── .frago/                    # frago internal files
        └── session.json
```

**When to use Workspace?**

- ✅ View AI-generated code
- ✅ Download Recipe execution results
- ✅ Check webpage screenshots
- ✅ View log files
- ✅ Verify files were generated correctly

**Tip**:
💡 You can also click the "Open in file manager" button to open the project directory in your system file manager.

## Q: What's the difference between Skills and Recipes?

**A**: Recipes are executable standardized recipes (code), while Skills are methodology documents that guide Claude's work (text). Beginners can ignore Skills initially.

**Simple Analogy**:

- **Recipe**: Standardized cooking steps that machines can execute directly
- **Skill**: Cooking tips and insights that teach chefs how to think

**Detailed Comparison**:

| Feature | Recipe | Skill |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Nature** | Standardized recipe definition | Markdown document |
| **Execution** | Can run directly | Not executable, read-only |
| **Purpose** | Automate repetitive tasks | Guide AI's decision-making process |
| **Example** | screenshot_tab.py | frago-chrome-navigation.md |
| **Users** | All users | Advanced users |

**When do you need Skills?**

When using Claude Code CLI, Skill documents are automatically loaded to help Claude understand frago's best practices. For example:
- `frago-chrome` skill teaches Claude how to operate Chrome
- `frago-recipe` skill teaches Claude how to write Recipes

**Beginner Advice**:
💡 When starting with frago, focus on using Recipes. Skills are for Claude to read, not for humans to use.

## Q: Why are some Recipes in "Local" and others in "Community"?

**A**: Local shows Recipes already installed on your machine, while Community shows Recipes available for installation from the official repository.

**Three-level Priority**:

frago searches for Recipes in this order:

1. **Project level** (`~/.frago/projects/[run_id]/recipes/`)
   - Recipes specific to current Run project
   - Highest priority

2. **User level** (`~/.frago/recipes/`)
   - Recipes you created or installed
   - Shared across projects

3. **Example level** (Built into frago installation)
   - Official example Recipes
   - For learning and reference

**Local Recipes include**:
- User-level Recipes (ones you installed)
- Recipes installed from Community
- Recipes you created yourself

**Community Recipes**:
- Official frago recipe library
- Hosted on GitHub
- Clicking "Install" will install to User level

**Example**:
```
You see: Local (5) | Community (15)

Local's 5 = 3 you previously installed + 2 you wrote yourself
Community's 15 = Available recipes in official library (excluding installed ones)
```

**Tip**:
💡 Installing Community Recipes requires GitHub CLI configuration, or you'll hit GitHub API rate limits.

**Related Questions**: Can't find Recipe after installation? (See Troubleshooting chapter)

## Q: What do the Dashboard charts mean?

**A**: Dashboard shows frago activity statistics for the last 12 hours, including session count, tool call count, and execution status distribution.

**Chart Interpretation**:

**1. System Overview Cards**:
- **Server**: Server status (Online/Offline)
- **Uptime**: Server running time
- **Tasks/Recipes/Skills**: Resource counts

**2. Activity Statistics**:
- **Sessions**: Number of tasks/sessions started in last 12 hours
- **Tool Calls**: Number of operations executed by AI (file reads, commands, etc.)
- **Completed/Running/Errors**: Task status distribution
  - ✅ Completed: Successfully finished
  - 🔄 Running: Currently executing
  - ❌ Errors: Failed execution

**What is a Tool Call?**

Each operation AI performs counts as one Tool Call, for example:
- Read a file
- Execute a shell command
- Screenshot a webpage
- Click a button

One task usually contains multiple Tool Calls.

**How to interpret the data?**

```
Sessions: 5       → You ran 5 tasks today
Tool Calls: 127   → AI executed 127 operations total
Completed: 4      → 4 tasks succeeded
Running: 1        → 1 task still executing
Errors: 0         → No failed tasks
```

**Tip**:
💡 If Tool Call count is very high without corresponding results, the task description might not be clear enough, causing AI to repeatedly explore.
